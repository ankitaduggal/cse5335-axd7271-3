? What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
Ans- The logic in itself using the Express package was easy to implement.
? What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
Ans- For me, implementing the NOSQL database was difficult. Each request needed to be pushed into the database and
also at a time there could only 20 records displayed at a time.
? If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest
concern?
Ans- I think time would be a concern. Not being alloted enough time in applying what you have learnt in a
professional environment would be a big disappointment.
